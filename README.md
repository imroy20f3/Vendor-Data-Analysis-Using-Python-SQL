# Vendor-Data-Analysis-Using-Python-SQL
This project focuses on building an automated data ingestion pipeline and performing exploratory data analysis on vendor and inventory datasets. Raw CSV files are efficiently ingested into a SQLite database using Python, Pandas, and SQLAlchemy with chunk-based loading to handle large datasets smoothly.

The ingestion process is fully automated, supports multiple CSV files, and includes logging to track progress, execution time, and errors. Once the data is stored in the database, exploratory data analysis is performed using Jupyter Notebook to identify trends, patterns, and key business insights from vendor data.

This project demonstrates practical skills in data database handling, logging, and data analysis, making it suitable for real-world analytics and ETL use cases
